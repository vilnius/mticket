# Data from m.Ticket system

m.Ticket is an app that could be used for purchasing tickets and giving feedback about public transportation.
There are a few datasets that we found as interesting at the moment, we will probably extend and automate it later.

- ratings.csv is the file with all customer ratings and feedback that was provided via app;
- ticket_stats.csv is an aggregated statistics document protraying sales of various different types of tickets;
- ticket_control.csv shows where and when tickets were presented for control.

In the mtis_schema.csv file you will find the existing table names and amounts of they data they contain in.
